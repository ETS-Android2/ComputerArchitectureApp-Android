## Synopsis
I was tasked to design a program using any language that would be capable of simulating CPU scheduling and memory allocation as a project for a subject in Temasek Polytechnic, CAOS (Computer Architecture and Operating Systems).

## Project Details

### Built With 
Android Studio 3.0

### Algorithms
The application features below algorithms for simulation : 

#### CPU Scheduling

  - First-Come-First-Served
  - Shortest Job First (Non-Preemptive)
  - Priority (Non-Preemptive)
  - Round Robin
  
#### Main Memory Allocation
  - First-Fit
  - Best-Fit
  - Worst-Fit

### External Libraries
* [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) - Animated Chart Display for  Memory Allocation
* [Shimmer](https://github.com/RomainPiel/Shimmer-android) - Shimmering Text View in CPU Scheduling




## Todos
**Please feel free to contribute to this project.**
 - Add in Priority (Preemptive) and Shortest Job First (Preemptive) to CPU scheduling algorithms
 - Fix UI to be dynamic (currently constrained to a 5.0 inch display)
